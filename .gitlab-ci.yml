# "Do not create two separate pipelines on commits pushed when branch has open merge request (mr pipeline)":
# Only an MR pipeline is created if there's a merge request linked to the branch on a push to it, otherwise, only a
# branch pipeline is created on a push (but never both kinds of pipelines at the same push)
